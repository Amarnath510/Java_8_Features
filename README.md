# Java 8 New Features Demo

## Interfaces with default and static methods </br>
  - From Java 8 we can have concrete methods in the interfaces but only using the key word **default**. <br/>
  - We also have static concrete method declared in the interfaces. <br/>

## Lambda Expression <br/>
  - It is an anonymous function that allows you to pass methods as arguments or simply, a mechanism that helps you remove a lot of boilerplate code.

## ForEach loop <br/>
  - In Java 8, we can now write for loop code which executes more faster than the usual for loops.

**NOTE:** Please go through Lambda expression before ForEach loop.

## Consumer Interface <br/>
  - From [JavaDoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Consumer.html), Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result.

## Stream API
  - Stream represents a sequence of objects from a source, which supports aggregate operations.
  - There are many stream API methods but here I have done for filter, map etc.
